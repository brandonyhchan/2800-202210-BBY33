            <h2 class="question">Q: How does Hope in a Box work?</h2>
            <p class="answer">A: Hope in a Box bridges the gap between prospective donors and charitable organizations.
                Our
                goal is to offer donors an additional layer of transparency and control so that they know exactly where
                and how their funding will be allocated. For more information, please visit the How it Works page.</p>

            <h2 class="question">Q: I forgot my password. What can I do to regain entry into my account?</h2>
            <p class="answer">A: For help with your account, please send an email to support@hopeinabox.com. An
                administrator will respond with the next steps.</p>

            <h2 class="question">Q: How will I know when the recipient receives my care package?</h2>
            <p class="answer">A: After placing your order, details such as order history and order status can be
                accessed through your profile by clicking on the icon in the footer. For desktop devices, orders can
                also be viewed by clicking on the “Orders” tab in the navigation menu.</p>

            <h2 class="question">Q: I am a local charity seeking a partnership with Hope in a Box. How can I apply to
                receive aid?</h2>
            <p class="answer">A: Charities can apply to receive aid by contacting an administrator at
                partnerships@hopeinabox.com. For more information, please visit the Partnerships page. (partnerships
                page should list some partnered charities, as well as describe the vetting process)</p>

            <h2 class="question">Q: Which parts of the world can I send care packages to?</h2>
            <p class="answer">A: Currently, Hope in a Box is sending care packages to Ukraine, Afghanistan, Yemen, and
                Ethiopia. The list of countries receiving aid is subject to change and is dependent on partnerships with
                local charities and socioeconomic climates. </p>

            <h2 class="question">Q: What payment methods are accepted?</h2>
            <p class="answer">A: Hope in a Box accepts payments from all major credit and debit card providers.</p>

            <h2 class="question">Q: How much will it cost for a care package to be shipped to another country?</h2>
            <p class="answer">
                A: We have partnered with international parcel couriers to ensure that the donors are not responsible
                for any costs associated with shipping and handling. This means that the price you see is the price you
                pay. The total amount of the order will be used towards curating an appropriate care package for a
                recipient in your designated location of choosing.
